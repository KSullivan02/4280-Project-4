This was another difficult project but I'm happy so far with what I have.
Program creation from terminal now works and invocation is now to specifications
Overall was very enjoyable once I got into the flow of recursion.

Invocation: 
./compile [file.4280fs24]

or ./compile
this version will allow program creation from inside the terminal
